# DjangoProject
Hello and welcome on board of "DjangoProject" ship! 
It's just a study project. Nothing really special. Represents simple blog with basic fuctions and pretty bad design. 
As you may have already guessed, this project's aim is to represent the possibilities of Django web-framework for Python.
That it's easy in use and that it can be used by people without proper experience for creating someting that will work 
and even amaze somebody.
